App components are components that are used for building out Maximo Applications and these components may depend on the Maximo JavaScript Framework.   Application Scaffolds, and Maximo Specific Header, Footer, Card, etc, components will live here.

These components are not the WorkOrder or Asset or Location components for specific apps, but, rather the components that are used to build apps.  Application specific components should be in a separate Application project.
