Hello Quentin,

I hope all is well.

The IBM MCP servers are a work in progress and seem a little over-complicated for my needs:

1. **Maximo Real Data MCP** - https://github.ibm.com/maximo/Maximo-Real-Data-MCP/blob/main/data/Home.md
   - This one is for data creation, not so much for development. I think I need to dig more into this.

2. **Graphite MCP Server** - https://github.ibm.com/maximo-app-framework/graphite-mcp-server
   - This one is over-complicated and focuses on the UI, prompting, and features of BOB. It also uses internal API packages, so I'm not sure it's ready yet.

I have created 2 alternative documents:

1. **Maximo_API_Interaction_Guide** - Uses just an IDE + AI + API + Swagger (API definition) to create Maximo apps. This approach should work in all IDEs.

2. **Maximo_MCP_Server_Guide** - Uses MCP to do the same thing, but more encapsulated/pre-manufactured, if you will.

I'm sure the OM will come up with their own approach as well. Anyway, if I'm a customer, I like having options.

I will put my stuff in IBM GitHub as well and will send you my GitHub links later. I'm also happy to help you set it up on your desktop. I can also create a video if that would be helpful.

We may need to check with them what their plan is, just to be sure we align. In any case, my API and MCP approach is generic, very open, and there is nothing they couldn't figure out themselves.

Let me know if you have questions.

Cheers,
Markus
